Cafe 2825 is an upscale dining experience using old school recipes. Located a block from the tropicana casino and across from tony’s baltimore grill, the restaurant serves authentic, (homemade) traditional italian cuisine with an upscale, casual, unpretentious ambiance. This originally owned and operated by the varalli family business of more than 30 year has returned to atlantic city; “the chicken parm is amazing.”.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title upscale italian restaurants in atlantic city by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
