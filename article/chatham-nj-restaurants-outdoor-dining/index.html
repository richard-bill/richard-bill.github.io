Source: tapinto.net</p><p>Check out our list below of local restaurants that will be offering outdoor dining starting next week (not all are opening on the 15th). We branched out to chatham in the year 2000 and running both the restaurants was quite exhausting. Now, best of nj is celebrating the reopening of many eateries by sharing the best outdoor dining restaurants in nj. The staff was prompt, courteous, very accommodating and patient.
