Palisades center is among the top ten most visited malls in america and is the premier shopping, dining and entertainment destination in rockland county. Now half the stores are closed, half the restaurants are closed or seem to have nobody in them, there�s nowhere to sit throughout the mall (due to the pandemic, all seating areas have been taken away). The palisades adventure climb also has the sky tykes ropes course on the 4 th floor of the mall for children too young or small to go on the regular ropes course.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://richard-bill.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/6241534_061020-wabc-palisades-center-mall-img.jpg?w=1600" alt="Reopen New York Palisades Center Mall Store Owners In West Nyack Push For Reopening - Abc7 New York" title="Reopen New York Palisades Center Mall Store Owners In West Nyack Push For Reopening - Abc7 New York" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://richard-bill.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
